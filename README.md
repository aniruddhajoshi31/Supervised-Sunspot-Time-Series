# Sunspot Time Series Forecasting

Predicting sunspot activity using time series analysis.

## Overview

This repository contains a model that forecasts sunspot activity based on historical data. 

## Dataset

The data represents monthly observations of sunspot counts, capturing the cyclical nature of solar activity.

## Model

The project utilizes a `RandomForestRegressor` for prediction.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook/Python script to train the model and see predictions.
3. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like RMSE.

## Results

The model achieves an RMSE of 16.7, indicating the average prediction error in terms of sunspot counts.
